<p> When I took the Career Interest Profiler assessment, my overall scores where Artistic, Enterprising, and Social as my top three. 
</p>
    <div id="number">
  <p> One of my top three choices of a carrer path with the information I recieved in the assessment is Broadcast Announcers adn Radio Disc Jockeys. For this career you need a 4 year education level. Some neccessary knowledge you need are communications and media, the english langauge(depending on where you are), computers and electronics. One big skill is the ability to speak, clearly and be able to convey information effectivly. You also need to be able to speak clearly as so others can hear you. I could not find any colleges or scholarships for none of the careers as I dont know how to look for them.</p>

      <div id="number">
    <p> My second choice is an Art Therapist. Your education level needs to be Graduate/Professional. You need to have knowledge in Therapy, counceling, psychology, and the fine arts. You need to have active listening skills as well as social perceptiveness.
