<p>My name is Saribel Yanez,Im from Ecuador and was born in the U.S.A. I have always wanted to be a tecaher since I was a kid but recently have gotten really interested in computer science. I am here taking this CTE class becasue I am really interested in how to make a webpage. I also want to be able to get a job in web design.</p>
<p>The head tag starts of the writing and the text for the page itself. No writing goes in between the head and body tags. The body tag gives you a place to place text you want in the tags.</p>
